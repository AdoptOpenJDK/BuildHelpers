# The bootstrap java compiler (defined as the javac in the ALT_BOOTDIR jdk).

#   used to build this jdk, e.g. run with the java in the ALT_BOOTDIR jdk.
#
# The javac supplied with the LANGTOOLS_DIST should be used to build the
#   classes that will be put into the built jdk. But note that this javac
#   will use the ALT_BOOTDIR java runtime. Any classes created by the
#   LANGTOOLS_DIST javac should not be run during this jdk build and indeed
#   may not even run with the ALT_BOOTDIR jdk because they may be a newer
#   class file version that the ALT_BOOTDIR jdk doesn't understand.
#
# The important observation here is that the built jdk is NOT run during
#   the build. If the built jdk needs to be verified that it can build this
#   same jdk, then it should be supplied to the build process as the ALT_BOOTDIR
#   jdk, and this resulting built jdk should be compared to the first one.
#   (They should be the same). Re-using this built jdk as the ALT_BOOTDIR
#   jdk will be the only way and the recommeneded way to verify the built jdk
#   can bootstrap itself.
#

# The javac options supplied to the boot javac is limited. This compiler
#   should only be used to build the 'make/tools' sources, which are not
#   class files that end up in the classes directory.
